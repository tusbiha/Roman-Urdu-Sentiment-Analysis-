# Sentiment Analysis on Roman Urdu Dataset

## Project Description
This project aims to perform sentiment analysis on a dataset of Roman Urdu text using various machine learning classifiers. 
The goal is to classify text as either Positive or Negative, providing insights into public sentiment on social media, reviews, and other platforms that use Roman Urdu.

## Features
- **Multiple Classifiers:** This project includes implementations of several classifiers, such as:
  - Naive Bayes (with both Count Vectorizer and TFIDF Vectorizer)
  - XGBoost
  - Passive Aggressive Classifier
  - Support Vector Machine (SVM)
  - Logistic Regression
- **User Input Prediction:** Users can input their own sentences for real-time sentiment analysis.
- **Comprehensive Evaluation:** Each model's performance is evaluated using precision, recall, and f1-score, providing a clear understanding of their effectiveness.

Dataset
The dataset used for this project is Roman Urdu DataSet.csv, which contains Roman Urdu text along with sentiment labels. Preprocessing steps include:
Removing emojis and correcting sentiment labels.
Filtering out 'Neutral' sentiment values.
